# sujood
Nearly a decade's worth of work to build prayer time apps. This time I'm doing it alone.

Sujood is an app that I had a vision to build since 2007. In its early permutations it was known as iAlif Compass. I built that with my original partner, Rozmail, who did the iOS app. Later, I recruited Hilwan and Firrdaus into the company. But development couldn't go further as Rezkii.com got most of my attention.

So I decided to do a reboot, and work on Sujood by the side and open source the project.

Right now, Sujood is a simple web app written in Javascript and HTML. It's using calculation methods instead of lookup tables, and that's the fundamental issue I was trying to solve for Singapore. Every app relied on a lookup table instead of the calculation method.

#TODO
- Background story of MUIS prayer times and how it's nearly impossible to get a proper calculation method
- How I figured out to get a reliable output based on the exact variables and offsets.
